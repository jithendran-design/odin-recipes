    <p>Savory Italian "cupcakes" baked in muffin cups!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>⅓ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>24 wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup pasta sauce (such as Muir Glen®)</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste <br>(Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Drain and discard grease from beef.</li>
        <li>Cut wonton wrappers into 2 1/4-inch circles with a biscuit cutter. Press one wonton into the bottom of each muffin cup. Sprinkle even amounts of Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and ricotta cheese into each muffin cup; top each portion with even amounts of ground beef and pasta sauce.</li>
        <li>Divide 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the ground beef mixture, and 1/2 cup pasta sauce, between the muffin cups and layer, respectively, atop wonton wrapper; repeat layering with remaining wonton wrappers, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, remaining ricotta cheese, remaining ground beef, and remaining pasta sauce. Top "cupcakes" with remaining Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until edges of "cupcakes" are browned, 18 to 20 minutes; let rest in tins for 5 minutes before running a knife around the edges to loosen and remove. Garnish with fresh basil to serve.</li>
    </ol>
